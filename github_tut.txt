*download git for windows from
https://git-scm.com/download/win

*click on the exe file, follow setup instructions
*Choose a default editor (I chose Notepad, the basic text editor for 
windows)
*Just click the other ones that are recommeneded idk what it all means

*open command prompt
*navigate to project directory (folder) by typing your equavalent of:
>cd Desktop (pressing tab after styping Des_ will predict what you want)(enter)
>cd Stats (enter)
>cd Project (enter)
or
>cd Desktop/Stats/Project (enter)

*clone git repository
>git clone https://github.com/vhyben/Stats-Honours-Project.git (enter)

Now you have a local version of the repository on your computer.

*run these lines on command prompt with your deets
>git config --global user.email "vhyben001@myuct.ac.za"
>git config --global user.name Ben

*To commit something to the project repository:
>git add "filename.Rmd"   (this "tracks" the file, prepares to commit. file must be inside git repo folder)
>git status               (optional, to check what files are added)
>git commit -m "explanation of upload"     (commits all files that were "tracked" to main branch)
This has commited the files to your local repository. 

*To upload to the remote (online) gitHub repo, run
>git push origin main
>git push
(at this point I had to do some authentication stuff on the first commit)

*to pull from remote repo (do this before you start editing, keeps all up to date)
>git pull origin main
>git pull ?

*making new branch called branch_name (so as not to mess with the main branch incase one cocks something up)
>git checkout -b "branch_name"
Now you are in this branch, and not in main any more. can now add files and things using add and commit 
(make sure not on main branch when committing)(check using >git status)

*pushing branch to remote repo
>git push origin branch_name

*switching to main 
>git checkout main
